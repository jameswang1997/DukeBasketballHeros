Did Grayson Allen have a better impact at Duke than Grant Hill? Can Marvin Bagley III beat Christian Laettner in offense? Jayson Tatum vs Shane Battier? 

Who is the better Duke Blue Devil? 

From the raw data of 481 Blue Devils of the 2,495 Duke games, I selected 53 best players across the last 34 seasons (1984-2018). Comparing any two players in the radar chart in their best season, we can see who indeed are the heroes of Cameron Indoors.
